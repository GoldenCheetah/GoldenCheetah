Golden Cheetah Wiki</a>.

<p>
What follows is a brief step-by-step guide to installing and setting up
Golden Cheetah.

<p>
<big><font face="arial,helvetica,sanserif">
Step 1 (optional): Installing the FTDI drivers
</font></big>

<p>
This step is only needed if you want to download rides from a powertap
pro/comp/cervo head unit via the supplied USB cradle. Furthermore, most
Windows and Linux systems should recognize the device without installing
the drivers below.

<p>
Depending on your operating system, you <i>may</i> need to install the
<ahref="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm">FTDI D2XX driver</a> if
you're using the PowerTap's new USB download cradle.
Note: version 0.1.7 of the FTDI drivers for Mac seems to be buggy.  Until they
post a patched version, you can download version 0.1.6
<a href="http://bugs.goldencheetah.org/attachments/download/1/Universal_D2XX0.1.6.dmg"> here</a>
and install via the terminal. Or if you are not terminal savvy, download an installer that will
perform the installation of the 0.1.6 drivers for you
<a href="http://bugs.goldencheetah.org/attachments/download/248/Install_D2XX_drivers.mpkg.zip">
here</a>.

<p>
If you're running Linux, you may also need to uninstall the <code>brtty</code>
(Braille TTY) application, as it interferes with FTDI's driver.  The command

<pre>
sudo apt-get remove brtty
</pre>

should do the trick on Debian/Ubuntu.  

<p>
The latest version (7.1.1) of Saris's PowerAgent software uses an incompatible
version of FTDI's driver from the one GoldenCheetah uses, and PowerAgent
removes the driver that GoldenCheetah needs when you install PowerAgent.  If
you want to run both GoldenCheetah and PowerAgent, you need to use PowerAgent
version 7.0.1 or earlier.  We're working to correct this problem, but we're
not there yet.

<p>

Step 2: Installing GoldenCheetah
</font></big>

<p>
To install GoldenCheetah, go to <a href="download.html">the download page</a>
and download the version for your operating system and processor.  

<p>
On Mac OS X, when the download finishes, Mac OS X should automatically open
the <code>.dmg</code> file for you.  If not, double-click to open it.  Drag
the GoldenCheetah icon into your Applications folder, and you're done.

<p>
The Linux version of GoldenCheetah is distributed as a GZipped archive.
Download this file and save it to <code>/tmp</code>, then from a terminal:

<pre>
cd /tmp
gunzip -vf GoldenCheetah_X.X.X_Linux_x86.gz
cd GoldenCheetah_X.X.X_Linux_x86
sudo cp GoldenCheetah /usr/local/bin
cd ..
rm -rf GoldenCheetah_X.X.X_Linux_x86.gz
</pre>

Be sure to replace "X.X.X" with the version of the release you downloaded,
such as "2.0.0".

<p>
<big><font face="arial,helvetica,sanserif">
Step 3: Running GoldenCheetah
</font></big>

<p>
To run GoldenCheetah on Mac OS X, double-click on the GoldenCheetah icon in
your Applications folder.  On Linux, just type "GoldenCheetah" at the prompt.

<p>
The first time you run GoldenCheetah, you'll get an empty "Choose a Cyclist"
dialog box:

<p>
<center><img src="choose-a-cyclist.png"></center>

<p>
Click on "New...", enter your name and click "OK", then select your name and
click "Open".  After that, the main GoldenCheetah window will open:

<p>
<center><img src="main-window.png"></center>

<p>
Your main window won't yet have any rides in it, of course.  To fix that, you
need either to download a ride from your PowerTap or import one from another
program.  GoldenCheetah can import <code>.srm</code> files recorded on SRM
power meters and <code>.csv</code> files created by other programs.  To
download a file from your PowerTap, select "Ride->Download from device..."
from the menu.  To import one, select either "Ride->Import from SRM..." or
"Ride->Import from CSV...".

<p>
Once you've downloaded or imported a ride, you can see some simple statistics
about it on the "Ride Summary" page: your total riding time and average power,
for example.  If you click on the "Ride Plot" tab at the top of the screen,
you can see a graph of your speed, power, cadence, and heart rate during the
ride.  The "Power Histogram" shows how much time you spent at each power
during the ride, and the "Notes" tab allows you to record notes about the
ride.  The "Weekly Summary" shows your total time and work for the week.

<p>
The "Critical Power Plot" is one of the most useful features of GoldenCheetah.
It shows the highest average power you attained for every interval length
during the ride.  Some people call this the "Mean Maximal Power" graph.  The
green line shows values for this ride; the red line shows the combination of
all your rides.  (If you only have one ride so far, the two lines will
overlap.)  Clicking on the graph with your mouse brings up a blue line, and
the values under this line are shown at the bottom of the screen.

<p>
It helps to think about an example:

<p>
<center><img src="critical-power.png"></center>

<p>
In this example, the blue line is right around the 14-second mark on the
x-axis.  So the values shown under "Today" and "All Rides", at the bottom, are
the hardest the cyclist went for any 14-second period during the ride itself
and during all rides he's ever recorded in GoldenCheetah.  Since the two
values are the same, he set a new personal record during this ride.

<p>
The Critical Power Plot is most useful before you're going to go do intervals
or a time trial.  Say you want to do six 2-minute intervals with three minutes
rest in between.  Click on the Critical Power Plot, drag the blue line to the
2-minute mark, and read the value shown in "All Rides".  That's the hardest
you've ever gone for two minutes.  Now go out and try to beat it!

<p>

Step 4: Setting Up Your Power Zones
</font></big>

<p>
If you look back at the screenshot above, you may notice that there are
several things shown in the "Ride Summary" tab that aren't on your version.
The picture above shows a non-zero "Bike Score", and there's a list of how
much time the cyclist spent in each "Power Zone" during the ride as well.  

<p>
BikeScore(TM) is a measure of the physiological stress you underwent during a
ride.  It was developed by Dr. Philip Skiba, and you can read more about it in
<a href="http://www.physfarm.com/Analysis%20of%20Power%20Output%20and%20Training%20Stress%20in%20Cyclists-%20BikeScore.pdf">an article he wrote</a>.

<p>
For GoldenCheetah to compute your BikeScore and the time spent in each power
zone, you first need to tell it what your power zones and critical power
are.  You can define your power zones however you like, maybe using the ones
defined by Joe Friel, for example.  Your critical power should be the
maximum power you can sustain over an hour.  Some people call this your
"lactate threshold" or "functional threshold power".  Our friend Bill says a
rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

<p>
There are currently three ways to set up your power zones.  Each method has
its benefits, so feel free to select the method that best suits your needs.

<p><b>Method 1: Set via critical power plot.</b>

<p> GoldenCheetah can determine a value for your CP value based on all
of the data in your critical power plot.  The calculated value of CP can
be used to create a new range in your power.zones file by clicking the
"save CP value" button in the lower right corner of the critical power
plot tab. The new range will use the default zone definitions (see Method 2).
Once the new range is set, you can manually edit the file to change the zone
definitions as in Method 3.

<p>
<b>Method 2: User preferences.</b>
<p>
From the menu bar select GoldenCheetah->Preferences, then click on
"cyclist info". The window should look like this:

<p>
<center><img src="cyclist-info.png"></center>


<p>
Enter a value for critical power at the top of the dialog and click save
to set your CP.  New ranges can also be set via this dialog so that you can
adjust your CP value throughout the season as your fitness increases (or
decreases). Once your CP is set, GoldenCheetah will set up seven power zones
based on percentages of your CP value.  The zones are:
<p>
<table align="center" width="450">
 <tr>
   <td>Zone</td>
   <td>Description</td>
   <td>Low</td>
   <td>High</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Z1</td>
   <td>Active Recovery</td>
   <td>0%</td>
   <td>55%</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Z2</td>
   <td>Endurance</td>
   <td>55%</td>
   <td>75%</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Z3</td>
   <td>Tempo</td>
   <td>75%</td>
   <td>90%</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Z4</td>
   <td>Threshold</td>
   <td>90%</td>
   <td>105%</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Z5</td>
   <td>VO2 Max</td>
   <td>105%</td>
   <td>120%</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Z6</td>
   <td>Anaerobic</td>
   <td>120%</td>
   <td>150%</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Z7</td>
   <td>Neuromuscular</td>
   <td>150%</td>
   <td>MAX</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>
If you want to use other zones boundaries or labels, you can manually edit
the power.zones file as described in Method 3.

<p>
<b>Method 3: Manually edit the power.zones file.</b>
<p>
To edit/create the power.zones file you'll need to use a text editor.
On Linux, that probably means nano, vi, or emacs. On Mac, the easiest
editor to use is TextEdit, which is in your Applications folder.

<p> Start by downloading <a href="power.zones">this sample file</a> and saving
it in your rider directory, which is listed in the GoldenCheetah->About GoldenCheetah
menu item.
<p>
Open the power.zones file in a text editor and you'll see this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
From BEGIN until 2006/07/17, CP=297:
  1, Active Recovery,     122, 167
  2, Endurance,           167, 228
  3, Tempo,               228, 274
  4, Lactate Threshold,   274, 319
  5, VO2 Max,             319, 365
  6, Anaerobic Capacity,  365, 678
  7, Sprinting,           678, MAX

From 2006/07/17 until 2007/02/05, CP=329:
  1, Active Recovery,     135, 185
  2, Endurance,           185, 253
  3, Tempo,               253, 303
  4, Lactate Threshold,   303, 354
  5, VO2 Max,             354, 404
  6, Anaerobic Capacity,  404, 752
  7, Sprinting,           752, MAX

From 2007/02/05 until END, CP=347:
  1, Active Recovery,     139, 191
  2, Endurance,           191, 260
  3, Tempo,               260, 312
  4, Lactate Threshold,   312, 364
  5, VO2 Max,             364, 416
  6, Anaerobic Capacity,  416, 774
  7, Sprinting,           774, MAX
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The format of the file is simple.  You define a range of time, starting with a
date or "BEGIN" to indicate the oldest possible time and ending with a date or
"END" to indicate the latest possible time.  Then you put your critical power
(CP) for that date range.  Then you list your zones, where each zone has a
number, a name, a minimum power value, and a maximum power value.  You can
have as many time ranges and zones as you like.  Most people enter a new time
range every time their critical power goes up--right after a fitness test, for
example.

<p>
NOTE: By default, Mac OS's TextEdit will try and save the power.zones file
with a <code>.txt</code> extension.  Use the menu command "Format->Make Plain
Text" to get it to let you save the file with a <code>.zones</code> extension
instead.
