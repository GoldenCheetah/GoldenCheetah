<p>
Golden Cheetah is available in binary form for
Linux x86, Mac OS X (universal binary), and Windows.
It is also available as source code.
</p>

<p>
Golden Cheetah downloads data from all versions of the PowerTap
computer including the new Joule. Previously you needed to have the
FTDI USB Drivers installed if you were using the PowerTap USB cradle
(as opposed to the older, serial cable). This should not be necessary.
If you are having problems then you can manually install the
 <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm">FTDI USB driver</a>.
</p>

<p>
On Linux and Mac OS X, Golden Cheetah also downloads from the SRM PCV.  On Mac
OS X, you'll need to install <a href="http://osx-pl2303.sourceforge.net/">the
open source PL2303 driver</a> to download from an SRM. Please see the
<a href="https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Installing-the-d2xx-drivers-on-mac-os">WIKI</a> article
 - <a href="https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/Pcv-on-mac-os-x">
PCV on Mac OS X</a> for further information.

<p>Gareth Coco has also made
<a href="http://goldencheetah.stand2surf.net/">regular development builds</a>
available.  These binaries are based on the latest source code, so they may have
more features and less (but sometime more) bugs than the stable release above.
