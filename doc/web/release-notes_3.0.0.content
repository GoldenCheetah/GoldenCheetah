Alejandro Martinez (49):
      Change Pace metric to follow metric/imperial units as configured
      Automatic CdA and Crr Estimation in Aerolab
      Add es and pt translation files set lang default according to system default
      Enable metrics translations     The code setting metric names and units was moved from constructors to     an initialize method, to be called after translator initialization.     English Name is preserved as InternalName for metadata.xlm compatibility     in metric override.     Q_DECLARE_TR_FUNCTIONS(class-name) macro is used to set tr() context     when class-name is not QObject sub-class.
      Enable translation on LeftRight metric
      Enable Metadata translation     This patch keeps the original english name of SpecialFields and SpecialTabs     as internalName, to preserve compatibility, while it uses a translated     displayName for user interfase in other languages.
      Enable translations in RideSummary     Includes default zone descriptions
      Enable AllPlot and Aerolab translations     Also update spanish translation
      Enable PerfPlot and PfPvPlot translations     Also includes a minor change in LTMSidebar

      Translate axis labels LTMPlot     Fixes #29
      Enable Measures Translation     For use in LTM metrics list
      Fix RideNavigator Translation     column names from xml file need to be translated to match translated headings,     other posibility would be to match before translation, but this option needed     fewer changes.
