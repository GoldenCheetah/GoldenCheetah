@center @strong{GoldenCheetah is an open source program for cyclists.}
@vskip 12pt
 
In fact, it is primarily a program for cyclists with a power meter. It provides functions
to download, import, edit, upload and analyse rides containing power data.
 
It can be used to analyse bike rides that do not contain power, perhaps containing speed,
cadence or GPS data. It can be used to analyse other kinds of workouts, perhaps run or
swim activities. It can be used purely as a log or journal for any activity.
 
@vskip 12pt 
@center @strong{GoldenCheetah is primarily an open source program for cyclists that own a power meter.}
@vskip 12pt
 
In addition to the post-workout analysis it can also be used as a desktop application to
record and monitor workouts on a cycle trainer. It captures telemetry from ANT+ sensors
and can also work directly with Bike trainers that provide the right kind of interface.
 
In this manual we will be explaining how to use and configure the functions within GoldenCheetah.
We will be describing it from the perspective of a bike rider. In all cases we will be describing
how the functions within GoldenCheetah work, and how to configure them.
 
This is not a manual on how to train with power. We would urge you to read other books for that
kind of information and would recommend `Racing and Training with a Power Meter' by
Dr Andrew Coggan and Hunter Allan.
 
@section About this latest version, V3.0

This manual has been written as a companion to the latest release of GoldenCheetah, v3.0.
Released in Spring 2013, it represented an overhaul of the code and was a major update.
 
If you are new to GoldenCheetah then all the functions it provides will be new to you, but
for existing users, version 3.0 had introduced;
 
@heading 500+ bug fixes and minor enhancements
 
It fixed 46 serious issues and over 400 bugs in over 1,500 different
commits. GoldenCheetah is now over 120,000 lines of code.  In addition
to addressing stability issues it also addressed a number of performance
related issues.  Whilst the new metric functionality and database means that
a modern PC is recommended, the code is still efficient enough to run on
a netbook.
 
@heading Redesigned UI and UX
 
One of the most immediate changes you will notice with v3.0 are the
major changes to the user experience and user interface. From the
initial help screens for new users through to the redesigned preferences
pane for advanced users, it is more complete and more professional.
 
There are 4 views available with specific and detailed sidebars for
performance tracking (home), short term tracking (diary) as well as
the well known analysis and training views from earlier releases.
 
It now allows you to view charts tabbed and tiled, you can resize and
move charts around and customise them using roll-over controls. The
activity list is fully configurable and can be configured to show any
number of columns.
 
@heading Support for the latest bike computers
 
It supports direct download features for the Cyclops Joule and Joule GPS
as well as the latest SRM Powercontrol 6 and 7. We also added support for
the O-sync Macro and Macro X.
 
@heading Support for more telemetry
 
Alongside the support for the latest bike computers it also added the ability to
track and plot new data series, including; Headwind, LR Balance, Temperature and
Slope.
 
@heading Export and Batch Export as well as lots of new file formats
 
It will now export and batch export your data to a wide variety of file
formats include TCX, PWX, JSON and XML as well as FITLOG and GPX.
 
It also supports reading files from SportTracks, GPX, Tacx CAF and the
SLF/SMF file formats. We have also added legacy WKO+ file format support
(CP 1.0 and 1.1) as well as import of Wattbike TXT exports.
 
@heading Support for a wide selection of internet services
 
It can upload and download data from; Withings, Zeo, Strava, TrainingPeaks,
Training Stage Buch, RideWithGPS as well as Internet based calendars (CalDAV)
such as Google Calendar.
 
@heading Realtime training significantly enhanced
 
Support has been added for native ANT+ removing the need for quarqd. Video Playback
is built in using VLC/QTKit. It now has a  media library to organise and reference
any video content you may have from Tacx Ergvideos through Sufferfest.
 
It supports Virtual Power for popular devices from KK, LeMond and many other
trainers.  We have added support for the amazing new Wahoo Fitness Kickr trainer
as well as the old Tacx Fortius.
 
It also introduces new ways to ride on the trainer including;
Streetview, SpinScan (on Computrainer) and an enhanced Workout Plot that plots
telemetry against the workout as you ride.
 
It also includes Computrainer calibration, a workout wizard and download
from ErgDB as well as Multi-device Support allowing you to ride with with
your ANT+ powermeter on your Computrainer, Kickr or Fortius.
 
@heading Advanced search and data filtering
 
It introduces free text search across all activities and a data filter (using the same search box)
to filter activities with specific properties. Some examples of using the filter might be
finding all rides with a TSS > 300 or perhaps those with an IF >0.9 and a duration of > 1hr.
 
The search and filter functions can be applied to the charts -- which means that
you can plot a PMC only where sport is "Bike" or perhaps power distribution but only
where the workout code is FTPTEST.
 
@heading Lots of new charts
 
It provides a new HR to Power analysis chart as well as a more utilitarian 2d scatter
plot. It will also use Bing as map provider for the Map chart.
 
The histogram and CP curve plots will now plot data for a date range rather than for
a specific ride and it will also now plot a mean max curve for HR, Power, Speed, Cadence,
xPower, VAM and NP.
 
@heading New metrics, including TrainingPeaks' TSS and NP
 
The TrainingPeaks metrics have been added to both the analysis functions as well as the
training functions (e.g. track TSS as you ride the trainer).
 
There are now over 100 different metrics and measures you can work with including things
like; Pace, Maximums, Gradient, VAM, wpk, time in HR Zones and many, many more.
 
@section Open Source
 
GoldenCheetah is an open source program. This means the source code is freely available to
download and compile. You can add new features and fix bugs. All we ask is that you then
share your work back to the main project.
 
This is how GoldenCheetah has developed since it was first created in 2006. Over 50 different
people have contributed new features and fixes in the 7 years since then.
 
@heading Mailing list
 
As you would expect there is an active community of users and developers, you can join the
discussion and contribute. The main GoldenCheetah website is @url{www.goldencheetah.org}
and the main mailing list is hosted on Google Groups and is called golden-cheetah-users.
 
@heading Reporting bugs and requesting new features
 
The code is hosted in a repository at GitHub. Github is an internet service hosting open
source and commercial code repositories for thousands of projects. In addition to hosting
projects GitHub also provides an issue tracker.
 
The issue tracker URL is: @url{github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/issues}.
 
We use the GitHub issue tracker to manage all bug reports and feature requests. If you are
looking for a new feature or have experienced a problem using the software then you should
consider raising it on the issue tracker.
 
As a non-developer one of the most valuable contributions you can make to the project is to
provide accurate and informative bug reports. This makes it easier for the developers to fix
the code and in turn makes the software better for everyone.

@section Bit of Past and Present
 
In early 2006 a Cat 1 racer called Sean Rhea bought a Powertap. Back then power meters were not
very common. They certainly weren't very open. The software options were very limited. But
Sean was a bit of a geek.
 
He set about reverse engineering the protocol the Powertap used to communicate with the PC and
he developed a couple of command line utilities in the C programming language; `ptdl' and `ptunpk'.
These utilities downloaded data from a Powertap via its serial interface saving to `raw' files
on disk, and then read that raw file and formatted the output for inputting into GNU plot.
 
But it soon became clear that using the command line was not at all user friendly. A GUI was
going to be required. And so, in late 2006 Sean set about writing a GUI version using the
QT framework and moving to the C++ language (because he needed to learn QT for his new job).
 
This early version had the main charts you see today, indeed a lot of that early code is still
present. It could plot the ride, histograms and the CP curve that it is famous for.
 
From 2007 with Sean leading many new people became involved and new features
were introduced; support for SRM using the libsrm project written by Rainer Clasen. Support for
Linux, Windows, Metrics, File Formats, Power Zones and a large number of new charts including
a Performance Manager written by Eric Murray. Google Map written by Greg Lonnon.
 
During this time the project moved from a `hack' project to a fully fledged open source development
project and saw Jamie Kimberley, Robert Carlsen and Justin Knotzke assist Sean in managing development
with the introduction of a bugs database and more formalised releases for Linux, Mac and Windows.
 
In Summer 2009 a lot of the current developers joined the project, notably Damien Grauser who added
much needed support for interval analysis and Mark Liversedge who contributed WKO+ file support and
the 3d plot. Over the next 12 months v2.0 was developed introducing the training View (with Justin Knotzke)
as well as the editor and tools, metadata and long term plotting charts.
 
At the tail end of 2010 Sean handed leadership of the project to Mark. Sean was no longer racing and most
development was now being delivered by others anyway. So in January 2011 Mark merged a number of features
that were being developed in private into the main repository and thus V3 development began.
 
In Spring 2013, after 3 years of development version 3 was released, along with this user guide.
 
Version 3 is a landmark release and provides a platform for future development - the modular views and
configurable layouts means it will be very easy to introduce new functionality and concepts without
needing to adjust the underlying code. In short, v3 provides a future platform.

@section Future Plans
 
Version 3.1 is already being planned and the high priority features include;

@itemize @bullet 
@item Planning functions centred around the concept of an interactive performance manager chart
where you set target events and physical adaptations or performance targets with a progression of
daily stress and long term stress.
 
@item Interval Analysis and Comparison across separate rides, to compare efforts and track and rank
performance in intervals or `segments' of rides and routes.
 
@item Season by Season progression to compare and rank performance development in cycles and seasons
across the long term charts, but also the critical power and distribution charts.
 
@item Separation of the training view into a separate program `OpenTrainer' to enable more advanced
graphical displays including video with overlay and animations.
@end itemize
 
Version 3.1, hopefully, will not take so long to come to fruition and is currently targeted for Spring
2014.

@chapter QUICK START GUIDE
@node QUICK

For those of you that are new to GoldenCheetah this section gets you up and running
with the software and using its basic features. For those of you with experience of
GoldenCheetah from previous releases, you might like to skip this chapter.
 
@section Downloading and Installing
There are four ways to get GoldenCheetah onto your PC and available for use:
@itemize @bullet

@item @strong{Download a Stable release build} - We maintain a stable release binary for download and installation
on the GoldenCheetah website, at @url{www.goldencheetah.org/download}.

@item @strong{Download a Development build}  - We also provide regular build updated of the
very latest code on the GoldenCheetah development build website, at @url{www.stand2surf.net}.

@item @strong{Build from Source} - Since we provide the source code for the program
you can get the source from GitHub and build your own.  But unless you plan on
contributing to the project this is probably a pointless exercise. You
could just use the pre-built binaries described above.

@item @strong{Apt-get install} - If you are running a Linux distro you can get the GoldenCheetah
binary and dependencies installed via apt-get. It is worth noting that at the time of writing
the V3 build has not yet been packaged.

@end itemize

Once you have the binary installed you can go ahead and run it, it doesn't need any
configuration before you start.
 
@section Running for the first time

When you run GoldenCheetah for the very first time it will prompt you with the Athlete 
selection dialog box. In GoldenCheetah we allow you to create as many athletes as you
like. This may sound like it is only useful for coaches, but in fact you may want to
set up a scratch athlete to play and learn.

Either way in this first run you will not have an athlete created, and will see a blank
dialog, asking you to select or create an athlete to work with:

@vskip 12pt
@center @image{"image/1-noathlete",140pt}
@center @emph{Figure 1: Initial Dialog}
@vskip 6pt

At this point you should go ahead and click `New...'. This will open another dialog
window to create a new athlete and set some basic data. 

@vskip 12pt
@center @image{"image/1-newathlete",140pt}
@center @emph{Figure 2: New Athlete Dialog}
@vskip 6pt

Whilst it is possible to configure these values in preferences or within an individual activity
you should go ahead and set up as much of the data as accurately as possible. These values
are used as defaults in many metric calculations. 

If you click on the blank athlete icon on the right it is possible to set an image for the athlete
too. This isn't used anywhere at present, but that may change in the future.

The LTHR value is the HR at which the onset of blood lactate accumulates, whilst the CP value is
the maximum theoretical watts you can hold for an hour. It is very similar to your FTP (if that
is a term you understand).

Once you're happy with the settings click save and you will then be able to select your new athlete
in that initial dialog (except of course there is now an athlete listed). Go ahead and open that
athlete and you will be greeted with GoldenCheetah, but a splash page.

@vskip 12pt
@center @image{"image/1-blankstate",280pt}
@center @emph{Figure 3: Analysis view splash screen}
@vskip 6pt

This page is shown because there is no data associated with this athlete. We need to go ahead and
download some data from your bike computer or import some data from disk or USB.

@section Downloading a ride from device

If you use a Powertap, SRM, Joule, Joule GPS or Macro-X device you will be able to download from
it directly. Please make sure the device is connected and plugged in correctly. For example, if you
are downloading from a Powertap please make sure the computer is firmly connected and displays
`HOST' on its screen.

@vskip 12pt
@center @image{"image/1-download",210pt}
@center @emph{Figure 4: Download Dialog}
@vskip 6pt

To start the download go ahead and click the download from device button. This will open up the 
download dialog. Select the right kind of device and serial port before clicking on the `Download'
button. If no serial port is listed, or the port is not correct you can click on the `Rescan' 
button to look again for your device. This is sometimes required if you click on `Download' before
the device is connected.

Any ride files will then be downloaded and imported into GoldenCheetah and the splash screen will
disappear to reveal the Analysis view of GoldenCheetah. Congratulations - you can now start using
GoldenCheetah to analyse and track your performance.
 
@section Importing data from file 

To import files into GoldenCheetah you have a couple of options. You can drag and drop them from 
a file explorer or from the desktop into the main GoldenCheetah window, or you can select them via 
the import files button on the splash screen.  Once you have done either the import activity 
wizard will appear to process the selected files.

@vskip 12pt
@center @image{"image/1-import",280pt}
@center @emph{Figure 5: Import Activity Wizard}
@vskip 6pt

You will notice that the files are opened first to ensure you have the required permissions to 
read them before being validated. Once validated the dialog will prompt you to edit any of the dates 
(some file formats do not include date information). Once you have set the dates (if needed) you can 
click on save to complete the import and save the files to disk.
 
The splash screen will now disappear and reveal the main GoldenCheetah analysis view and you can
now start analysing and tracking your performance.

@vskip 12pt
@center @image{"image/2-mainwindow",280pt}
@center @emph{Figure 6: Main window elements}
@vskip 6pt

Regardless of whether you are training with your bike trainer, reviewing recent activities in the diary
or tracking long term performance in the home view, the GoldenCheetah layout is always the same.

Looking at the figure above you will see the following components;
@itemize @bullet

@item @strong{Menu Bar} - this contains all the menu options for GoldenCheetah. The screenshot shown is
from the Mac OSX version, but the menu bar is similar in modern Linux distributions. On Windows the menu
bar will be seen within the main window rather than at the top of the screen.

@item @strong{Tool Bar} - the toolbar contains buttons to get quick access to functions that also available
within the menu bar. We place them in the toolbar because they are used very commonly, and it is handy to be
able to get at them quickly and easily.

In V3 the toolbar is biased towards functions used during analysis, but this may change as we get more feedback
from users about what they use most commonly in the other views.

@item @strong{Scope Bar} - the scope bar is used to select the view. Each view offers different functionality as
their names suggest. Additionally there is a `+' menu to the right of the scope bar for adding charts to the view
selected.

@item @strong{Side Bar} - the side bar contains selections and lists that are most appropriate for what the user
is currently doing. It changes as different views are selected in the scope bar.

@item @strong{Main View} - selected via the scope bar the main view shows the charts and windows relevant to the
view in question. Analysis View contains analysis functions and so on. Note that the view can be shown in a tabbed
style or a scrolling set of tiles.

@end itemize

The only time the main window looks different to that shown above is when running for the first time or when no
data is available. In this case a `splash' screen is shown to assist new users in importing data or setting up
devices etc.
@page
@section The Menu Bar

The GoldenCheetah menu bar is no different to any other application. The only slight confusion is the location of the
preferences pane across platform. On Windows and Linux the preferences pane can be found as Tools->Options whilst
on a Mac it is found as GoldenCheetah->Preferences.

@strong{NOTE:} Each menu is now explained in the section below, but depending upon the options installed when
the program was built you may not see all the menu options listed. If you installed a stable build from the 
GoldenCheetah website it will have all available options compiled in @emph{this is not the case for Development builds}.

@heading The @emph{Athlete} menu

The Athlete menu is largely about opening and closing new windows. Since in GoldenCheetah we open a new window to
work with a specific athlete (you cannot switch athlete in the main window, you need to open another window). As a
result this menu is rather trivial:

@itemize @bullet

@item @strong{New...} - Opens the new athlete dialog we saw in the quick start guide and then proceeds to open a
@item @strong{Open...} - Opens the choose athlete dialog in order that you select an athlete to open in a new window.
@item @strong{Close} - Closes the current athlete window.
@end itemize

@strong{NOTE:} When you restart GoldenCheetah it will always open the athlete you last opened, so if you open up an
athlete and close to go back to a previous window the last Athlete that was opened will be displayed, rather than the
last one you closed. You can specify which athlete to open on the command line e.g. @code{$ ./GoldenCheetah "Mark Liversedge"}.

@heading The @emph{Activity} menu

In GoldenCheetah we refer to a ride file or any file that contains data related to an exercise you have completed as an `Activity'
this is because simply referring to it as a `ride' wouldn't be valid if, for example, it was a run!

Additionally, a prescribed activity plan (e.g. 2x20 mins at L4) we refer to as a `workout'. This may be confusing to users
that come to us from TrainingPeaks WKO+ where a workout refers to a past activity. We refer to future activities as planned
activities and past activities as just activities. 

So, this menu contains functions for working with activities -- past exercises that have been recorded and imported into GoldenCheetah.

@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Download from device...} - Also available from the tool bar this function opens the dialog to download data 
directly from a device. We support SRM Powercontrol, Powertap LYC, Joule and Macro-X devices.
@item @strong{Import from file...} - This option will open a file selecton box to select one @emph{or more} files to import. Once 
selected the files will be processed by the import wizard.  You can also import files by just dragging and dropping them 
on the analysis view.

@strong{NOTE:} If you try and drag and drop on the training view we will try and import videos and workouts (not activities).
@item @strong{Manual activity entry...} - This will open up a dialog box to create a manual entry. There is also a button on
the toolbar that does this. A manual activity gives you the opportunity to estimate time, distance, stress and other metrics
for an activity that wasn't record (for example on a gym bike). @xref{Importing Exporting Downloading and Creating Data, Manual activity}.
@item @strong{Export...} - Will open a dialog box to export the currently selected activity. You can select the directory
to export to and the file format to write the export as. This is particularly useful if you want to send your data to a 
coach who requires data in a format his software understands.

For example; PWX files can be read by WKO+ and Garmin TCX files can be read by almost all sports software. 

@strong{NOTE:} Whilst we offer FITLOG format for SportsTracks we would not recommend it, since the fidelity of the 
file format is very suspect. 
@item @strong{Batch export...} - This opens the batch export dialog, it provides the ability to select the output
directory and format to export to as well as select the activities you wish to export. Since this functions is
typically used to export data for import into another program there is a select all option too.
@item @strong{Export Metrics as CSV...} - Although the metric database is a sqlite file it can be useful to export
all the metrics as a comma separated variable format to work with in a spreadsheet. This function will export all
columns and rows to a CSV file of your choice.
@item @strong{Upload to TrainingPeaks} - This will upload the currently selected ride to TrainingPeaks.com. There are
no options since the account and password need to be defined in the preferences pane before you start.
@item @strong{Download from TrainingPeaks...} - This will open the download dialog for TrainingPeaks.com. It allows
you to select the specific activities you want to download and will match the available activities to any existing
activities by examining their date and time.
@item @strong{Upload to Strava...} - This opens the upload to strava dialog to allow you to select which data
series you want included.
@item @strong{Download from Strava...} - Download from Strava requires a Strava activity ID. Once you provide this
the activity will be downloaded and imported into your activity library. Note that there is no option to select
activities from a list since Strava do not support this (data lock-in).
@item @strong{Upload to RideWithGPS...} - This will upload the currently selected ride to RideWithGPS.com. There
are no options required.
@item @strong{Upload to Trainingstagebuch...} - This will upload the currently selected ride to TrainingStageBuch.com.
The user id and password need to be configured in the preferences pane in order for this to work.
@item @strong{Save activity} - We do not automatically save changes to activities, if you want to update the
activity you must save it. The metrics for the activity will only be updated when it is saved.
@item @strong{Delete activity...} - Permanently deletes the ride from the ride library. There is no undo so use
with caution. It will prompt to confirm you really mean it.
@item @strong{Split activity...} - Will open the split activity wizard, this wizard will allow you to find
breaks in an activity and split it into separate activities. This is of particular use when you forget to
stop recording and end up with multiple activites downloaded as a single activity.
@end itemize

@heading The @emph{Tools} menu

The Tools menu contains a selection of `handy' utilities, its a bit of a catch all for functions that are
either related to manipulating activities or don't really fit in anywhere else.

@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Options...} - Only on Linux and Windows this opens the preferences pane. Note that the preferences
pane is an application in its own right and will remain open even when you have closed the main windows. You can
also have multiple preferences panes open at once @strong{we recommend you do not do this}.
@item @strong{Critical Power Estimator...} - Opens a dialog to estimate your CP based upon a short and long
power best or result from a specific test. We recommend using 3 minutes and 20 minutes since that aligns
with the algorithm used (Monod/Scherer).
@item @strong{Air Density (Rho) Estimator...} - Opens a tool for estimating Air Density based upon temperature
and air pressure. This is useful when working with Aerolab.
@item @strong{Get Withings Data...} - Downloads all measures for you Withings weight scale, but the user id
and public key need to be configured in the passwords section of the preferences pane.
@item @strong{Get Zeo Data...} - Downloads sleep data for your Zeo sleep monitor. You will need to have
configured the user id and password in the preferences pane.
@item @strong{Create a new workout...} - Opens the workout wizard for creating a training view workout. This
will create a `.erg' or `.crs' workout.
@item @strong{Download workouts from ErgDB...} - Opens a dialog to select and download training view workouts
from the internet ErgDB website.
@item @strong{Import workouts or videos...} - Opens a file dialog to select and import a workout or video into
the training view library.
@item @strong{Scan disk for videos and workouts...} - Opens a dialog to scan directories for workouts and
videos and import into the training view library.
@item @strong{Upload Activity to Calendar} - Will create a calendar entry to any CalDAV based calendar service.
You will need to configure the URL, user and password in the preferences pane before using this.
@item @strong{Refresh Calendar} - Will read any entries from your CalDAV internet calendar to display on the 
calendar view.
@item @strong{Find intervals...} - Opens a dialog to find intervals in the current activity. This menu option
is here since it has always been on the tools menu. It should really be moved to the @emph{Activity} menu.
@item @strong{Adjust Torque Values...} - An editor tool for adjusting the torque data series. This is useful
when using a Powertap without calibrating.
@item @strong{Fix GPS Errors...} - An editor tool for extrapolating and adjusting GPS values, this is useful
when your GPS device lost its satellite connection or after importing from other software and the data
contains invalid values.
@item @strong{Fix Gaps In Recording...} - GoldenCheetah expects all data series samples to have timestamps
separated by a consistent recording interval (e.g. every 1 second). This tool dialog allows you to
extrapolate values where there are gaps in recording. In future releases we may remove the need for the 
data series to have regular timestamps.
@item @strong{Fix HR Spikes...} - Find and smooth out spikes in HR, usually caused by loss of connection or
interference from overhead power lines.
@item @strong{Fix Power Spikes...} - Find and smooth out spikes in Power, usually caused by reed switch
being double triggered or recording interference.
@end itemize

@heading The @emph{View} menu

The View menu provides a menu access to the view configuration, showing and hiding UI elements as well as
switching fullscreen and adding charts to the layout.

@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Toggle Full Screen} - As the name suggests toggles between normal and full screen. On
Linux and Mac this is also available from the F11 key (and you can use the ESC key to leave full
screen mode too). On Mac Lion we use the standard toolbar button for switching between normal and
full screen mode.
@item @strong{Show Left Sidebar} - Toggles the display of the sidebar.The button on the toolbar also
does the same. You can also drag and close the sidebar by hand.
@item @strong{Show Toolbar} -  Toggles showing or hiding the tool bar.
@item @strong{Tabbed View} - Toggles tabbed or tiled mode for the current view.
@item @strong{Analysis} - Switch to the Analysis view.
@item @strong{Home} - Switch to the Home view.
@item @strong{Train} - Switch to the Training view.
@item @strong{Diary} - Switch to the Diary view.
@item @strong{Add Chart} - Opens a submenu to select a chart to add. When selected an add chart dialog
will be open showing the chart and allowing you to adjust the chart settings before it is added to the
current view.
@item @strong{Reset Layout} - Will reset the current view layout to the application default. This is
useful if you spoil your setup, or want to fall back to the current application default. Note that the
application default will change and improve over time.
@end itemize

@heading The @emph{Window} menu

Simply lists the current windows you have open and allows you to select the window to raise and make 
the current window focus.
@page
@section The Toolbar and Scope bar

@vskip 12pt
@center @image{"image/2-toolbar",350pt}
@center @emph{Figure 7: Tool Bar and Scope Bar}
@vskip 6pt

Working from left to right in the toolbar, there are a number of buttons to download and import
activities that are mostly relevant to the analysis view;
and lastly a search box;
@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Download Activity} - Will open a dialog to download an activity from a supported
device (including Powertap Cervo, SRM Powercontrol, O-Synce Macro, Saris Joule).
@item @strong{Compose Manual Activity} - Will open a dialog to manually enter an activity, for
example when you worked out at a gym and could not record the data.
@item @strong{Find Intervals} - Will open a dialog to find peak and best intervals in an activity.
@item @strong{Split Activity} - Will open a dialog to split an activity into separate activities.
This is useful when you have an activity that spans multiple days.
@item @strong{Delete Activity} - Deletes the currently selected activity. Will prompt the user to
confirm before doing so.
@end itemize

Then to the right of the toolbar there are a trio of buttons to control the way the 
main window is laid out;
@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Show/Hide Sidebar} - Will toggle the visibility of the sidebar, if it is hidden it
will how it. If it is shown it will hide it.
@item @strong{Tabbed Mode} - Switch the main view into tabbed mode. See Views and the Sidebar below.
@item @strong{Tiled Mode} - Switch the main view into tiled mode. See Views and the Sidebar below.
@end itemize

Lastly to the right of the toolbar there is a search/filter box;
@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Mac OSX only Search box} - On a Mac the search box is limited to text search only, this
may change as it means one cannot use it to filter the activity list with a data filter.
@item @strong{Windows/Linux Search/Filter box} - On Windows and Linux the search box can be toggled
between a search box and filter box by clicking on the search or filter icon inside the box (and to
the left hand side). See searching and filtering below for more details.
@end itemize

Beneath the toolbar is the scope bar, this is a selector to choose from one
of four views in main view -- essentially its a selector for choosing what
you want to do with GoldenCheetah, it offers four views;

@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Home} - The home view is for long term tracking and allows you to work with charts that 
plot and analyse metrics. It is intended to be used to reviewing progress and identify what is and is
not working (or perhaps historically, what has worked and what hasn't).

In this view the scope is @emph{generally} limited to the date range or season selected in the associated
sidebar -- the currently selected ride is not relevant in this view.

@item @strong{Diary} - The diary view is for tracking recent rides - looking at the data in terms of the 
last day, week or month. As planning functions arrive in v3.1 this view will become more functionally
rich, but for now it is more or less a configurable version of the old @emph{Weekly Chart}.

In this view the scope is limited to the day, week or month of the currently selected activity. As you
select different activities the date range changes to reflect this.

To select the summary level (day, week or month) the summary sidebar contains a drop down selector.
See Figure 8 below.

@center @image{"image/2-dayweekmonth",70pt}
@center @emph{Figure 8: Summary level selector}
@vskip 6pt

@item @strong{Analysis} - The analysis view is where you review and analyse individual activities. 
As well as using the numerous analysis charts you can also edit and adjust the telemetry data within
the activities and add your own narratives and texts.  The narrative fields are configurable to 
your tastes, see `Metadata' in chapter 4.

In this view the scope is limited to the currently selected activity in the sidebar.
@end itemize

To the right of the scope bar is a `+' menu button;
@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Add Chart (`+') Menu} - The charts on each view can be configured and added or deleted.
The `+' menu to the right of the scope bar lists all the charts that are available for the currently
selected view, see Figure 9 below. Selecting a chart from this menu will open the add chart dialog, which is described 
below in the section @emph{Adding and adjusting charts}.

@vskip 12pt
@center @image{"image/2-chartmenu",180pt}
@center @emph{Figure 9: The `+' Add Chart Menu}
@vskip 6pt
@strong{NOTE:} Only the windows that are relevant for the current view will be listed. You cannot, for example, add a long term
metric chart to the analysis view, or a performance chart (all plot) to the diary view.
