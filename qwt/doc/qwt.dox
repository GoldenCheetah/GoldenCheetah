  \mainpage Qwt - Qt Widgets for Technical Applications

The Qwt library contains GUI Components and utility classes which are primarily
useful for programs with a technical background. Beside a framework for 2D plots 
it provides scales, sliders, dials, compasses, thermometers, wheels and knobs 
to control or display values, arrays, or ranges of type double.
