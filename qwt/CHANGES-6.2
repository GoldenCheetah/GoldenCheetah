Qwt 6.2.0
=========

0) Requirement for Qt >= 4.8

1) Class Includes added

Include files, that match the class names are available now. So
it is possible to write "#include <QwtPlot>" now instead of "include qwt_plot.h"

2) BSD License for examples

Where possible the code of the examples is available under the 3-clause BSD License 

3) MathML text renderer removed

The code can be found at https://github.com/uwerat/qwt-mml-dev now and is intended
to become a standalone lib. Anyone who is interested to workon it, please let me know.

4) Spline interpolation

The broken implementation of QwtSpline has been replaced by a bunch of classes
offering all sort of functionalities around splines.

The most popular spline approximation/interpolation algos have been implemented:

	- Basis
	- Cardinal
	- ParabolicBlending
	- Akima
	- The one used in MS Excel
	- Cubic

An implementation of the de Casteljauâ€™s algorithm has been added

	- QwtBezier

5) New plot items

	- QwtPlotVectorField
      A new type of plot item for vector fields

    - QwtPlotGraphicItem
      An item displaying a QwtGraphic image ( f.e used by QwtPlotSvgItem )

6) Plot Canvas

	- QwtAbstractPlotCanvas introduced
	- QwtPlotOpenGLCanvas added to support QOpenGLWidget

7) QwtPlotCurve

	- QwtPlotCurve::FilterPointsAggressive mode added - a fast weeding algo
      for huge datasets with increasing x or y values

	- QwtPlotCurve::closestPoint is virtual now
	- QwtPlotCurve: polygon clipping includes the painter clip
	- QwtPlotCurve::setLegendAttributes added
	- QwtValuePointData added for curves, where the x values are the index
	- a couple of new QwtPlotCurve::setSamples alternatives

8) QwtPlotSpectrogram

	- QwtPlotSpectrogram::setColorTableSize added
	- QwtRasterData::setInterval/interval changed into a pure virtual getter
	- QwtMatrixRasterData::BicubicInterpolation added
	- QwtMatrixRasterData::interval: API cleanup
	- QwtHueColorMap, QwtSaturationValueColorMap added

9) QwtPlotRenderer

	- using QPdfWriter where possible

10)
	- LOG_MIN/LOG_MAX removed, use QwtTransform::LogMin/LogMax instead ( values differ ! )
	- qwt_compat.h removed
	- qwtFuzzyGreaterOrEqual/qwtFuzzyLessOrEqual removed
	- qwtGetMin/qwtGetMax removed

11)
    - Not aligning unknown paint engines ( f.e EMF )
    - QwtNullPaintDevice is using a different type than QPaintEngine::User now

12) Many other changes ...
