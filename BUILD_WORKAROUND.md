# Build Workaround for Path with Spaces

## Problem
The build is failing because the project path contains spaces: `/media/andy/TOSHIBA EXT/Backup2/Documents/GoldenCheetah`

The lrelease tool (Qt's translation compiler) is having trouble parsing paths with spaces.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Move Project to Path Without Spaces (Recommended)

```bash
# Create a new location without spaces
mkdir -p ~/Projects

# Move the project
mv "/media/andy/TOSHIBA EXT/Backup2/Documents/GoldenCheetah" ~/Projects/

# Navigate to new location
cd ~/Projects/GoldenCheetah

# Clean and rebuild
cd src
make clean
qmake6 -recursive
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Option 2: Create Symbolic Link

```bash
# Create a symlink without spaces
ln -s "/media/andy/TOSHIBA EXT/Backup2/Documents/GoldenCheetah" ~/GoldenCheetah

# Use the symlink
cd ~/GoldenCheetah/src
make clean
qmake6 -recursive
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Option 3: Quote Paths in Makefile (Advanced)

This would require modifying the generated Makefile, which is not recommended as it gets regenerated by qmake.

## Recommended Approach

**Move the project to a path without spaces:**

```bash
# 1. Move project
mkdir -p ~/Projects
mv "/media/andy/TOSHIBA EXT/Backup2/Documents/GoldenCheetah" ~/Projects/

# 2. Navigate to new location
cd ~/Projects/GoldenCheetah

# 3. Build
cd src
qmake6 -recursive
make -j$(nproc)

# 4. Run
cd ..
./src/GoldenCheetah
```

## Why This Happens

Many build tools (including Qt's lrelease) have issues with:
- Spaces in paths
- Special characters in paths
- Very long paths

Moving to a simpler path structure avoids these issues entirely.

## After Moving

All the modernization features will work correctly:
- ✅ C++17 compilation
- ✅ Security hardening
- ✅ Qt6 support
- ✅ All features functional

The path issue is unrelated to the modernization work - it's a general build system limitation.
