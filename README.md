# GoldenCheetah

## About 

GoldenCheetah is an open-source data analysis tool primarily written in C++
with Qt for cyclists and triathletes 
with support for training as well. 

GoldenCheetah can connect with indoor trainers and cycling equipment such 
as cycling computers and power meters to import data. 

In addition, GoldenCheetah can connect to cloud services. 

It can then manipulate and view the data, as well as analyze it.
