1. BASIC INSTALLATION WITH MANDATORY DEPENDENCIES
=================================================

Installed Ubuntu 11.04 from CD image amd-64.iso. You will not need to do this if you
already have a Linux distribution installed. Left this step in to highlight the
Linux distribution the commands below were executed on.

login and open a terminal to get a shell prompt

Download MANDATORY DEPENDENCIES (browser)
-----------------------------------------
Download and install the Qt 4.8 SDK from http://qt-project.org/
Once that is completed test qmake is ok with: qmake --version (should report 4.7.0 or higher)

Install git with:
$ sudo apt-get install git
Said Y to prompt about all git files installed (git-gui et al)

Install FLEX and BISON
----------------------

You will need flex v2.5.9 or later
$ sudo apt-get install bison
$ sudo apt-get install flex
$ vi gcconfig.pri

Ensure you have the following lines (which are now also in gcconfig.pri.in which has
been updated to reflect the new dependencies in version 3)

QMAKE_LEX  = flex
QMAKE_YACC = bison
win32 {
  QMAKE_YACC = bison --file-prefix=y -t
  QMAKE_MOVE = cmd /c move
  QMAKE_DEL_FILE = rm -f
}

Build!
------
$ make clean
$ qmake
$ make

You will now have a release3 binary but with none of the release3 dependencies compiled in.
Get latest GOLDEN CHEETAH source files
--------------------------------------
$ mkdir -p ~/Projects/Live
$ cd ~/Projects/Live
$ git clone git://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah.git
$ cd GoldenCheetah

Configure MANDATORY DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------
$ cd qwt
$ cp qwtconfig.pri.in qwtconfig.pri
$ cd ../src
$ cp gcconfig.pri.in gcconfig.pri
$ vi gcconfig.pri

Comment out the D2XX_INCLUDE and SRMIO_INSTALL lines for now (put # in first character of the line
to comment out), we will install that in a moment, if we need to.

If you are building for your local host you may find that you get better performance if
compiling with gcc -O3 (tree vectorization can have a significat impact) [or -Ofast]

If so you might like to uncomment:

QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -O3

Save and exit

$ cd ..

BUILD WITH BASIC CONFIGURATION
$ qmake -recursive
$ make

Congratulations you have now build a basic GoldenCheetah and can run this safely. See below for
optional dependencies you can install to support other features.

ADDING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES WHEN BUILDING VERSION 2
====================================================

D2XX - For Powertap downloads via USB
-------------------------------------

Download the FTDI drivers from http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm (e.g. I used Linux 
64-bit drivers from http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX/Linux/libftd2xx1.0.4.tar.gz)

Extract into your home directory (I put mine into ~/Projects/ with archive manager which
created a sub-directory ~/Projects/libftd2xx1.0.4

$ cd src
$ vi gcconfig.pri

Uncomment the D2XX_INCLUDE entry and make it match (my home is /home/markl)
D2XX_INCLUDE = /home/markl/libftd2xx1.0.4

Make clean is needed if you have previouslt built, since source files examine #defines before
including this feature. You can skip it if you know why ;)
$ make clean
$ qmake
$ make

You now have D2XX support, for downloading from a PT via a USB cradle.

SRMIO - For SRM powercontrol V downloads via Serial
---------------------------------------------------

$ cd ~/Projects
$ git clone git://github.com/rclasen/srmio srmio
$ cd srmio

Get automake and tools, if you don't already have them (I didn't after a fresh install)
$ sudo apt-get install automake
$ sudo apt-get install libtool

Generate the configure script, run it, build and install srmio
$ sh genautomake.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Lets go config GC and build with SRMIO
$ cd ~/Projects/Live/GoldenCheetah/src
$ vi gcconfig.pri

Uncomment the SRMIO_INSTALL and replace with the target used from srmio install:
SRMIO_INSTALL = /usr/local/

At the bottom of gcconfig.pri you will see the include directory should reference from
the base install location (/usr/local) make sure it says:

SRMIO_INCLUDE = $${SRMIO_INSTALL}/include
SRMIO_LIB = $${SRMIO_INSTALL}/lib/libsrmio.a

Make clean is needed if you have previouslt built, since source files examine #defines before
including this feature. You can skip it if you know why ;)
$ make clean
$ qmake
$ make

You now have SRM support built in.

OAUTH/CRYPT - For Tweet my ride (twitter) support
-------------------------------------------------

You should be able to install liboauth and dependencies
directly with:
$ sudo apt-get install liboauth-dev

If this does not work then:

    Download the source from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/liboauth/files/liboauth-0.9.4.tar.gz/download and
    unpack it into ~/Projects/liboauth-0.9.4 using archive manager

    $ cd ~/Projects/liboauth-0.9.4

    You may find that libcurl is not installed (which liboauth depends upon) so download it
    from http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.21.6.tar.gz and unpack it into ~/Projects/curl-7.21.6
    using archive manager to drag and drop into your Projects folder

    $ cd ~/Projects/curl-7.21.6
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

    You should now have libcurl and friends installed in /usr/local

    You may find that liboauth also requires the openssl libs installed, these are available
    pre-packaged thankfully so:
    $ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

    This will also install zlibg which liboauth also desires.

    $ cd ~/Projects/liboauth-0.9.4
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Now we have liboauth and libcurl in /usr/local and libssl in /usr/lib, so we can go back to
GoldenCheetah and update the gcconfig.pri to point at the right places:

$ cd ~/Projects/Live/GoldenCheetah/src
$ vi gcconfig.pri

Make sure the following are set:
LIBOAUTH_INSTALL = /usr/local
LIBCRYPTO_INSTALL = -lcrypto
LIBCURL_INSTALL=-lcurl

Make clean is needed if you have previously built, since source files examine #defines before
including this feature. You can skip it if you know why ;)
$ make clean
$ qmake
$ make

You can now tweet your rides and amaze your friends, or alternatively tweet your rides but
omit to mention average power to hide your weaknesses.

LIBQWTPLOT3D - For 3D plot
--------------------------

Download the tarball from http://qwtplot3d.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qwtplot3d/branches/maintain_0_2_x/qwtplot3d/?view=tar
and unarchive it into your Projects directory using archive manager. There is no version number it just creates a
subdirectory called qwtplot3d

You will need to install libgl and extensions, this can be done with;
$ sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libglu-dev

On Ubuntu 12.10 I also ran
$ sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev

$ cd ~/Projects/qwtplot3d
Edit the qwtplot3d.pri and add
CONFIG += staticlib

You will find that on modern Linuxes you also need to fix include/qwt3d_global.h by adding the line:
#include <GL/glu.h>

then build
$ qmake
$ make

Then to let gc know where the qwtplot3d libs are you need to edit gcconfig.pri;
$ cd ~/Projects/Live/GoldenCheetah/src
$ vi gcconfig.pri

And uncomment the following line and set the install directory to where you build
QWT3D_INSTALL = ~/Projects/qwtplot3d



LIBKML - For export to Google Earth
-----------------------------------

You will need Google Earth 5.2 or later and therefore libkml that supports this. Unfortunately at the time of writing
the officially packaged libkml is too old, so you will need to install from source, which means you will need to have
subversion installed and expat. You may be able to use the currently packaged libkml with

$ sudo apt-get install libkml-dev

if this does not work you will need to build from source:

    $ sudo apt-get install subversion
    $ sudo apt-get install expat libexpat1 libexpat1-dev

    Once svn is installed you can grab the libkml source and configure build etc:
    $ cd ~/Projects
    $ svn checkout http://libkml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ libkml
    $ cd libkml

    You will need automake and friends (see SRMIO above)
    $ sh autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ sudo make install

    If you get errors about use of 'long long' then edit:
    - src/kml/{convenience,dom,engine,regionator,xsd}/Makefile
    - examples/{engine,gpx,gx,hellonet,helloworld,regionator,xsd}/Makefile
    - and look for the flag -pedantic and remove it. I got this on Linux 64bit builds ymmv.

Once libkml is installed and built:

$ cd ~/Projects/Live/GoldenCheetah/src
$ vi gcconfig.pri

Ensure KML_INSTALL=/usr/local

Make clean is needed if you have previously built, since source files examine #defines before
including this feature. You can skip it if you know why ;)
$ make clean
$ qmake
$ make

You can now export rides to Google Earth kml format.

ADDING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES WHEN BUILDING VERSION 3
====================================================


NOTE: When you run version 3 it will refresh ride metrics and CP files -- this only occurs the
      first time it runs (and will refresh only rides that change after that). I find it is best
      to import ride files once your build where you want it. i.e. don't import until you have
      got all your dependencies sorted.

NOTE: To reduce the dependencies on 'dormant' code there are a number of new pieces of source
      that are included in the release3 tree. Notably; qtsoap from qt-solutions, since they
      work but are likely to be archived and deprecated. If and when that happens we may well
      adopt whatever classes Trolltech introduce.


LIBICAL - Diary integration with Google or MobileMe calendars
-------------------------------------------------------------

$ cd ~/Projects/Live/GoldenCheetah/src

$ sudo apt-get install libical-dev
$ vi gcconfig.pri

ICAL_INSTALL=/usr/include
ICAL_LIBS=-lical

Since the src.pro wants ICAL installed in a different place we need to hack it, *** this will
be fixed shortly ***

$ vi src.pro

Comment out the ICAL_LIBS entry:

#ICAL_LIBS = $${ICAL_INSTALL}/lib/libical.a

$ make clean
$ qmake
$ make

You should now have diary functions.

NOTE: That upload to MobileMe and Google requires a functioning https lib in QT. Depending
      upon the version installed this might not be the case and will need to be built and
      configured -- this is beyond the scope of this walkthough. Sorry.

LIBVLC - Video playback in Realtime (Experimental)
--------------------------------------------------

You will need libvlc 1.1.9 or higher (1.1.8 is ok but will segv on exit)
$ sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev

$ vi gcconfig.pri

Comment out VLC_INSTALL and it should read:

VLC_INSTALL = /usr/include/vlc/

$ make clean
$ qmake
$ make

CLUCENE - Indexing and Searching ride files (search box)
--------------------------------------------------------

You will need clucene runtime and core libraries, we developed against 0.9.21b-2 but
any 0.9 branch should work fine, let us know if you experience any issues. You may find
that the libclucene0ldbl runtime is already installed, this is fine and typical since
clucene is a very popular search library.

$ sudo apt-get install libclucene-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libclucene0ldbl

By default, and this is deliberate, the clucene install places the config headers into
a platform specific location. For my install I just copy the platform (linux) specific
header config into the normal /usr/include/CLucene directory with the following:

$ sudo cp /usr/lib/CLucene/clucene-config.h /usr/include/CLucene

Next we need to comment out the two CLUCENE lines in gcconfig.pri and they should read:

CLUCENE_INCLUDE = /usr/include/CLucene
CLUCENE_LIBS    = -lclucene

$ make clean
$ qmake
$ make
