NOTE

The sources in this sub-directory including the LICENSE and README files
are imported with permission granted by the author (Greg Hamerly).

The original sources are available from Github here:

Whilst the original source implements multiple algorithms we only kept
the hamerly variant.

The source files have not been adapted to use Qt containers or to refactor
any of the class inheritance. So updating to newer versions should be
very straightforward (although the base functionality and performance is
good enough).

Usage in Qt applications will likely use the Kmeans wrapper class
