// This metric computes aerobic decoupling percentage as described

//
//   http://www.trainingbible.com/bkp-all/pdf/AeT_Training.pdf
//   http://home.trainingpeaks.com/blog/article/aerobic-endurance-and-decoupling
//
// Aerobic decoupling is a measure of how much heart rate rises or
// how much power falls off during the course of a long ride.  Joe suggests
// that a rise of more than 5% in the heart rate to power ratio between the
// two halfs of a long ride indicates that the ride was performed above the
// aerobic threshold.
//
// How you actually compute these things over messy data isn't always
// straightforward.  For this implementation, I cut the set of data points in
// half and compute the average power and heart rate over all the points in
// either half that have a non-zero heart rate.  I then calculate the change
// in heart rate to power ratio as described by Friel.
