LINUX ACCESS PERMISSIONS FOR GARMIN USB2 STICK

When using Garmin USB2 sticks on Linux the udev rules that
control access to the USB devices tend to mount the Garmin
stick with permissions that restrict access to normal users.

To change the way permissions are granted you need to configure
udev with a rules file.

On UBUNTU and other Debian based distros this is achieved by 
writing a rules file and placing it in /etc/udev/rules.d.

We have createed that file (51-garmin-usb.rules) here and 
you will need to copy it into /etc/udev/rules.d for the
Garmin stick to be accessable from GoldenCheetah when run
as a normal (not root) user.
